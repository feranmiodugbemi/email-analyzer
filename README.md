2. **Web Interface**: Create a web dashboard to view and manage analyzed emails.
3. **Custom Voice**: Use Twilio's advanced TTS voices for more natural-sounding calls.
4. **Scheduled Runs**: Instead of running continuously, schedule the script to run at specific times.
5. **Email Actions**: Implement functionality to reply to or forward important emails automatically.
